# <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ingan121/WMPotify/refs/heads/master/theme/src/resources/icon/wmpotify_48.png"> WMPotify
* A Windows Media Player 11 inspired Spicetify theme for Spotify
* Supported versions: 1.2.45 - 1.2.85
    * Primarily tested on 1.2.82
    * 1.2.45: `Show Global nav bar with home button, search input and user avatar` must be set to `home-next-to-search` in the experimental features
    * 1.2.71: Some features may not work properly due to issues in the Spotify client itself
    * 1.2.44 and below are not supported
    * Try updating Spicetify, or refreshing the CSS map by running `spicetify restore backup apply`, if you encounter issues on supported versions

## **Installation** / Updating

### **Manual installation using Scripts (recommended):**

#### **Windows (Powershell)**

* WMPotify + WMPotify NowPlaying + Windhawk + CEF/Spotify Tweaks mod
    * This script detects whether Spotify, Spiceify, Windhawk, and CEF/Spotify Tweaks mod are installed or not. If not, it will install them.
    * If Windhawk is installed and CEF/Spotify Tweaks mod is up-to-date, the installation of these two will be skipped.

```powershell
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
iex "& { $(iwr -useb 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ingan121/WMPotify/master/installer/install.ps1') }"
```

* Theme only:
```powershell
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
iex "& { $(iwr -useb 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ingan121/WMPotify/master/installer/install.ps1') } -Install @('wmpotify')"
```

* WMPotify NowPlaying only:
```powershell
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
iex "& { $(iwr -useb 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ingan121/WMPotify/master/installer/install.ps1') } -Install @('wmpvis')"
```

#### **Linux/macOS (Bash)**

* WMPotify + WMPotify NowPlaying
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ingan121/WMPotify/master/installer/install.sh | sh
```

* WMPotify NowPlaying only:
```bash
export SKIP_THEME=true
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ingan121/WMPotify/master/installer/install.sh | sh
```

### **Manual installation**
1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/Ingan121/WMPotify/releases)
2. Locate Spicetify directories: use `spicetify config-dir` or `spicetify path userdata`
3. Extract the contents of the WMPotify zip to the `Themes\WMPotify` folder in the Spicetify directory. Create the `Themes\WMPotify` folder if it doesn't exist.
4. Extract the contents of the WMPotify NowPlaying zip to the `CustomApps\wmpvis` folder in the Spicetify directory. Create the `CustomApps\wmpvis` folder if it doesn't exist.
5. Run the following commands in Command Prompt / PowerShell / Terminal:
    ```cmd
    spicetify config inject_css 1 replace_colors 1 overwrite_assets 1 inject_theme_js 1
    spicetify config current_theme WMPotify
    spicetify config custom_apps wmpvis
    spicetify apply
    ```
6. Windows only: Install [Windhawk](https://windhawk.net/) and [CEF/Spotify Tweaks mod](https://windhawk.net/mods/cef-titlebar-enabler-universal) for the full experience (optional but recommended)

### **Using Spicetify Marketplace (simpler installation):**

1. Install the `spicetify-marketplace` extension following its instructions: [https://github.com/spicetify/marketplace/wiki/Installation](https://github.com/spicetify/marketplace/wiki/Installation).
2. Search for "WMPotify" in the Spicetify Marketplace and click "Install."
* Warning: The Spicetify Marketplace version may load slowly due to the large number of images in the theme.

### Notes for Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 users:
* The installation script requires PowerShell 5.1 or later. If you are using an older version, you can update it from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54616).
* Before running the installation script, you will need to install WMPotify-compatible versions of Spotify and Spicetify manually and apply appropriate workarounds (e.g. [VxKex](https://github.com/i486/VxKex)) for them to work on your system.
* You may need to run the Spotify executable with the `--no-sandbox` flag to get the Windhawk mod working properly with Aero Glass, etc. Add the flag to the Spotify shortcut, `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\Spotify` (for autostart), and `spotify_launch_flags` key in `%appdata%\spicetify\config-xpui.ini` (for Spicetify).

## **Uninstallation**

### **Manual uninstallation using Scripts (recommended):**

#### **Windows (Powershell)**
```powershell
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
iex "& { $(iwr -useb 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ingan121/WMPotify/master/installer/install.ps1') } -Action Uninstall"
```

#### **Linux/macOS (Bash)**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ingan121/WMPotify/master/installer/uninstall.sh | sh
```

### **Manual uninstallation**
1. Run the following commands in Command Prompt / PowerShell / Terminal:
    ```cmd
    spicetify config custom_apps wmpvis-
    spicetify config current_theme marketplace
    spicetify apply
    ```
    Replace the second line with `spicetify config current_theme " "` if you don't plan to use themes from the Spicetify Marketplace, or you don't have Marketplace installed.
2. Delete the `Themes\WMPotify` and `CustomApps\wmpvis` folders in the Spicetify directory. Find the directory with `spicetify config-dir` or `spicetify path userdata`.

## Frequently Asked Questions
1. **Q:** Queue list does not show up in the right panel
    * **A:** Check `Enable Queue on the right panel.` in the user button -> `Experimental features`.
    * If this still does not work and the Experimental features popup shows `Using fallback mode`, you need to downgrade Spotify to a version fully supported by Spicetify. Old releases are available [here](https://loadspot.pages.dev)
2. **Q:** Aero Glass or the mini mode does not work
    * **A:** Currently those features are only available on Windows, and if you have installed the [CEF/Spotify Tweaks](https://windhawk.net/mods/cef-titlebar-enabler-universal) [Windhawk](https://windhawk.net/) mod. macOS is not supported now, and it needs more research to implement them.
    * For Linux, you can use [libcef-transparency-linux](https://github.com/fixpointer/libcef-transparency-linux) by [fixpointer](https://github.com/fixpointer) to enable transparency. You may need to apply additional mods like force blur.
    * For the mini mode, you might get it working by force resizing the window to a smaller size with an external tool. I will implement a custom miniplayer in the future that looks like the mini mode.
    * KDE users: [You can get the mini mode working with Window Rules](https://github.com/Ingan121/WMPotify/issues/31).
3. **Q.** Custom title bar only shows the close button
    * **A.** Either the CEF/Spotify Tweaks Windhawk mod or the Spotify API Extender Chrome extension is required for the minimize/maximize/restore buttons to show up. The extension is available in the [SpotifyCrExt](/SpotifyCrExt) folder in the repository.
    * Using the extension is only recommended if you cannot use the Windhawk mod, such as on Linux or macOS.
    * To install the extension, you have to enable DevTools with `spicetify enable-devtools`, right-click any empty space, click `Show Chrome Tools`, open `chrome://extensions`, enable developer mode, and load the unpacked extension. If the extension installation doesn't work, run `spicetify enable-devtools` again and try again.
    * Note that Chrome extensions only work if DevTools is enabled. Spotify will randomly disable DevTools after a while and all extensions will stop working. To permanently enable DevTools and extensions, hex-patch the Spotify executable to fill the `disable-extensions` string to something invalid.
4. **Q:** This theme is too slow!
    * **A1:** Make sure hardware acceleration is enabled in Spotify settings. 
    * **A2:** Remove the Beautiful Lyrics extension if you have it installed. This extension is known to slow down Spotify. Use WMPotify NowPlaying instead.

## Switching Between Custom and Native Title Bar
* This only applies to Windows users with the CEF/Spotify Tweaks mod installed.
* To use the native Windows title bar:
    * Open the Windhawk UI and go to the details page of the CEF/Spotify Tweaks mod.
    * Go to the Settings tab and enable the `Enable native frames and title bars on the main window*` option.
    * Restart Spotify.
    * In the WMPotify Properties, set the `Title style` to either `Auto` or `Native` and apply the changes.
* To use the custom title bar (WMP11 XP styled):
    * Open the Windhawk UI and go to the details page of the CEF/Spotify Tweaks mod.
    * Go to the Settings tab and disable the `Enable native frames and title bars on the main window*` option.
    * Restart Spotify.
    * In the WMPotify Properties, set the `Title style` to `Custom` and apply the changes.
    * It is also recommended to set the `Style` to either `Auto` or `XP` for the best experience with the custom title bar.

## TODO
* More customizable lyrics options
    * Colors, fonts, etc.
    * Probably gotta just bring the MADVis Lyrics config window code
* More skins
    * WMP10-ish one from [this wmploc mod](https://www.deviantart.com/fediafedia/art/WMP-11-Vista-Beta-76164120)
    * Bitmap-less skin with colors and SVG icons only (WMPotify Lite?)
* Custom Miniplayer implementation with XP WMP11 mini mode look, based on documentPictureInPicture
* Make the bars visualization more smoother
    * Weighted interpolation?
